# Geospatial Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and data for a geospatial analysis project. The project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of geographical data and derive insights through various geospatial techniques and models.

## Project Overview

The geospatial analysis project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered geographical data from various sources, including geospatial databases, APIs (e.g., Google Maps API), public datasets, satellite imagery, and user-generated data.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing or inaccurate geographical data, converted data into standardized formats, and preprocessed spatial information, including coordinate system transformations.

3. **Geospatial Data Exploration and Analysis**: Conducted exploratory analysis on geographical data, visualized geospatial distributions, performed hotspot analysis, and identified spatial patterns using Geographic Information System (GIS) software and Python libraries like Geopandas, PySAL, or Plotly.

4. **Feature Engineering for Geography**: Created new features based on geographical attributes, such as distance, area, density, or location-based aggregations, to provide additional insights.

5. **Geospatial Model Selection**: Chose appropriate geospatial analysis techniques or machine learning models for the specific geography-related problem. Evaluated options like spatial regression, spatial clustering, geostatistics, or spatial interpolation.

6. **Geospatial Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained the selected geospatial models using the training data and evaluated their performance using spatial evaluation metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for spatial interpolation or spatial autocorrelation metrics for spatial clustering.

7. **Geospatial Hyperparameter Tuning and Validation**: Optimized hyperparameters of geospatial models using techniques like spatial cross-validation or custom validation methods that account for spatial autocorrelation.

8. **Final Model Training and Testing**: Trained the selected geospatial model on the entire training dataset and evaluated its performance on a separate test dataset.

9. **Spatial Visualization**: Visualized the results of the geospatial analysis using choropleth maps, heatmaps, contour plots, or other spatial visualization techniques.

10. **Geospatial Insights and Interpretation**: Interpreted the results of the geospatial analysis to derive meaningful insights and implications for decision-making.

## Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

- `data`: Contains the geographical data used in the analysis.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the geospatial analysis project.
- `scripts`: Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `visualization`: Code for generating spatial visualizations and plots.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need Python with the required libraries installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/geospatial-analysis.git
cd geospatial-analysis
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to follow along with the step-by-step analysis.

## Documentation and Reporting

The detailed documentation for each step of the geospatial analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebooks. The final results, insights, and implications are summarized in the project report located in the `docs` directory.
